# ADelivery-aplicatie_licenta

For my bachelor's thesis, I chose to develop a system of applications that will serve for placing food orders online from partner restaurants (similar to the Glovo, BoltFood model, etc.). The system is composed of three applications: two Android applications for customer users and couriers, and one desktop application for restaurant users. I used Android Studio to create the Android applications, Java as the programming language (the files licentaappclient and licentaappcurier), and XML as the markup language for the graphical interface of the two applications (layoutappclient and layoutappcurier) and for the animations in the graphical interface (animappclient) of the customer application. For the desktop application (licentaapprestaurant), I used the Java programming language and the Java Swing framework. For the database, I used Firebase services that offered a cloud non-relational database.
