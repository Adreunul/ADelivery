# ADelivery-thesis_application

  For my Bachelor's thesis, I chose to develop a system of applications designed for online food ordering from partner restaurants (similar to Glovo, BoltFood, etc.). The system is made up of three applications: two Android apps for customers and couriers, and one desktop app for restaurant users.
I used Android Studio to create the Android applications, with Java for programming (files: licentaappclient and licentaappcurier) and XML for the graphical interface (layouts: layoutappclient and layoutappcurier), as well as for animations in the client appâ€™s interface (animappclient).
For the desktop application (licentaapprestaurant), I used Java along with the Java Swing framework. The database is managed using Firebase services.
